Eat Your Vegetables? (past)
The U.S. federal government displayed even less sense than usual and yielded to the French fry 
industry. Frozen French fries—cut, fried in oil, and then packaged— have been approved as 
“fresh vegetables” by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
The French fry industry has been asking the USDA for years to get this approval. They said 
that their product is similar to cucumbers that have wax on them. They argued that they use 100 
percent vegetable oil, which is much healthier for consumers than plain wax. 
Most consumers, of course, beg to differ. “You must be joking,” said Annie, 50. “How can you 
think a product that’s deep-fried in oil is a fresh vegetable? Even if I cooked broccoli, I could no 
longer call it fresh broccoli—it’s cooked! I wish I were a big company, so my congressman 
would help me. Unfortunately, I’m only a citizen.” 
The USDA defended its decision and said that potatoes undeniably are vegetables. Although 
French fries are fried in oil, they are still potatoes. “If you let them sit on your counter for a 
couple of weeks,” a USDA spokesman said, “the fries will rot just like all other fresh 
vegetables”. 
Consumers said the USDA totally lost touch with the public. “They'd probably say that 
eggshells are healthy if a company asked them to,” said one consumer.
